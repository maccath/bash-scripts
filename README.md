#Bash Scripts

A selection of simple but useful bash scripts I use, primarily at work.

To configure, please rename the existing `sample.cfg` file to `configuration.cfg` and edit it to fit your own 
configuration.

To create aliases for the functions, edit your bash profile with something similar to the following:

    bash_scripts='/path/to/this/project/'
    alias scriptalias="${bash_scripts}script_filename.sh"
